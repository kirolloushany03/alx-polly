# Capstone Project Reflection

This document is a reflection on the process of building the ALX Polly project, with a specific focus on the role of AI-assisted development.

## My Experience with AI-Assisted Development

*(Please describe your overall experience here. How did you feel about using AI as a development partner? Was it a force multiplier? Did it change your workflow?)*

## What Worked Well

*(Detail the specific areas where AI provided the most significant benefits.)*

### 1. Scaffolding and Boilerplate
*(Example: "Using the AI agent to generate the initial Next.js components and API routes saved a significant amount of time...")*

### 2. Logic and Feature Implementation
*(Example: "When implementing the poll results chart, I asked the AI to find a suitable library and generate the implementation code, which was much faster than reading the documentation from scratch...")*

### 3. Debugging and Error Resolution
*(Example: "I encountered an authentication error when pushing to GitHub. The AI correctly identified the cause and provided clear instructions on how to resolve it...")*

### 4. Documentation and Commit Messages
*(Example: "The AI was helpful in generating clear and concise commit messages, and it helped structure the README.md file...")*

## Limitations and Challenges

*(Discuss the aspects where AI was less helpful or even created challenges.)*

### 1. Context and Specificity
*(Example: "Sometimes the AI would generate code that didn't quite fit the project's existing style or conventions without very specific prompting...")*

### 2. Over-reliance and "Black Box" Code
*(Example: "I had to be careful not to blindly accept the AI's suggestions without fully understanding them, as this could lead to subtle bugs...")*

## Lessons Learned and Future Application

*(Summarize what you've learned about prompting, reviewing, and iterating with AI. How will you apply these skills in future projects?)*

*This reflection should be approximately 500 words.*
